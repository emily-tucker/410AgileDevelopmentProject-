 *
 * DATA EXAMPLE 15765481 Jill Masters has not seen or heard from her ex-lover,
 * Roderick "Rick" Usher , or her best friend, Madeline "Maddy" Usher, for three
 * years. One night, Rick contacts Jill and informs her of Maddy's sudden death.
 * Her last wish was for Jill to attend the funeral. Conflicted, Jill returns to
 * the family home of the Usher family. Her love affair with Rick is rekindled
 * as she learns he suffers from the same malady that robbed his twin sister,
 * Maddy, of her sharp mind before taking her life. His affliction is manifested
 * in a rare nerve condition, which renders him hypersensitive. Under the
 * watchful eye of the caretaker, Nurse Thatcher , Jill appears to be haunted by
 * the ghost of Maddy. In the meantime, Jill becomes intimate with Rick and
 * tells him she has missed her period. A pregnancy test confirms Jill is
 * pregnant. In the meantime, Jill has discovered that the Usher family has
 * practiced incest for the past five or six generations, right down to Maddy
 * and Rick. All the prior generations had twins, who later became a couple and
 * birthed twins of their own and so on down the line to Maddy and Rick, who
 * were to continue the Usher curse of incest and inbreeding.
